# Task-Reminder

This is a python Script to send Email notification and Whatsapp notification For some fixed Schedule. I used this Script to remind me about my labs during my online classes. I have used SMTPLIB and Twilio for email and whatsapp Services. I have used "schedule" for scheduling tasks.(pip install schedule)
